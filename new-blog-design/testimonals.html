						<p>It was hard for an intern in Gojek to step up as a permanent employee and Rizky was one of a few people who managed to do it. I had a pleasure working with Rizky when I led Business Intelligence team and she supported a new product line. She built the database for GoKitchen and tableau dashboard as well as did analysis for users to make any decisions. Rizky’s ability to reach out to relevant stakeholders was tremendously valuable for the success of her projects. I miss the time when she always brought snacks whenever she came back from her hometown - they were all delicious! For anyone looking a data analyst, I would definitely recommend Rizky.</p>
